## About

The game of virtual cricket is a simple game of chance and is played by two players. The players select to bat or bowl depending upon the results of toss. The players start to play the game by simultaneously revealing a number of fingers. The person who chooses batting keeps on adding the numbers he reveals until both the players reveal the same number of fingers, in that case the batsman is considered to be out. The batsman sets the target for the bowler to chase. In the end, the one who scores more, wins the game.
